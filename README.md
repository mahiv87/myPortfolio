# My Portfolio

---

## Description

<ul>
    <li>For this project my goal was to create my personal portfolio to allow potential employers to view my work.</li>
    <li>I used CSS Grid, a linear-gradient background, text-shadow, and box-shadow for the hover transitions.</li>
    <li>The work I have completed provides a visually pleasing UI, that contains content only important to employers.</li>
    <li>My css grid, and form making skills were strengthened during this project.</li>
</ul>
